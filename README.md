So this will be a website with a few pages.

We'll have a page with the males and females, a home page, about, breeding garuntee, contact us?

There is a logo its on their facebook page.

They want the main colors to be black and white.


Things of note:

Every website nowadays had that stupid nav bar at the top.

For breeders that have multiple breeds they do a section for each breed.

Will want the date of birth, the gender, name, picture of the dog, and a way to contact on the page.

A blog has appeared on some.

Generally the entire page is not used rather its more like 50-75% of it.
