        <h1>The Kennel of Southern Roc Airedales</h1>
        <p>
            In 1984 Frank Drach first opened Southern Roc in Pheonix Airzona. We took our time finding just the right
            just the right stock to go with and on the following pages you will see all that we have done in the last 40
            something years.

            Southern realizes when she is a little girl that she will dedicate her life to breeding dogs. After all, it
            is in her blood; she grew up with dogs in her father's kennel in the swamps of Alabama. A business woman who
            with her husband has devoted over 30 years of her life to breeding Airedale Terriers, specializing over time
            on a unique breed --- a Black Airedale. The growing acclaim of their Black Airedales is interrupted as they
            faces an intimidating fight against intimidation and slander from competing breeders and the greed and
            corruption of lawyers and large socio-educational clubs. They are forced to defend their reputation and her
            career and their beloved dogs in the competitive world of dog breeding.
