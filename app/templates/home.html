            Southern realizes when she is a little girl that she will dedicate her life to breeding dogs. After all, it
            is in her blood; she grew up with dogs in her father's kennel in the swamps of Alabama. A business woman who
            with her husband has devoted over 30 years of her life to breeding Airedale Terriers, specializing over time
            on a unique breed --- a Black Airedale. The growing acclaim of their Black Airedales is interrupted as they
            faces an intimidating fight against intimidation and slander from competing breeders and the greed and
            corruption of lawyers and large socio-educational clubs. They are forced to defend their reputation and her
            career and their beloved dogs in the competitive world of dog breeding.
